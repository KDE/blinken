FREE FONTS FOR THE LITTLE PEOPLE...
  *
Thank you for downloading my font!
These fonts are free to anyone who wants to use them.
 All I ask is that you e-mail me :: yahoo@fontalicious.com :: and tell me where I can see it. If you use this font for print use, I would love a copy of whatever it is used for.

If you are going to redistribute my font, please include this Read Me text file and a link to my page. That's it! Actually, you don't have to link to my page, but I sure would like it!

Thanks for reading this. Have a super day!
