blinKen uses a special handwriting font called Steve that is in the
fonts directory to show the status text. If this font is not currently installed
on the target system, on first run blinKen uses the fonts:/ ioslave to copy it
to the user's fonts location.

This can cause problems, because if the program
is used by 100 users there will be 100 copies of the font, one for each user.

To solve that we suggest making a package with "Some Juicy Fonts"
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/sjfonts) that includes the Steve font
and make the blinKen package depend on it.

If you do not want/cannot do that, please make blinKen depend on
having kdebase installed as the fonts:/ ioslave is there.
